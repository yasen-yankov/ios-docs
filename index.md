**TKFeedbackController** enables your end-users to provide feedback inside your app by simply shaking their device or navigating to the feedback option. Once invoked, the component will automatically take a screenshot and prompt users to point to their issue and provide a comment. The users can then track the feedback they've submitted, viewing its status or supplying additional comments. The component's seamless integration with AppFeedback (a part of the Telerik Platform) allows for organizing and reviewing all feedback items, assigning those to members in your Telerik Platform workspace and responding directly to users. The end result is actionable feedback, and easy interaction between your users and team members.

The **DataSync** (Beta) component is a powerful new solution for synchronizing application data across all devices and the cloud. Its smart syncing algorithms taking place on the device will ensure that the changes made to data while offline, will be synced with the cloud once your app is connected again. On the cloud side, the data-sync framework is backed up by Telerik BaaS. On the device (client) side, the data-sync provides a lightweight ORM that allows you to model your data in SQLite.
